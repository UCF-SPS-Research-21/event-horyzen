**Event hoRyzen** is a Python library designed to simulate and visualize
geodesic motion around Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and
Kerr-Newman black holes. It uses a slightly modified version of Pierre
Christian and Chi-kwan Chan's FANTASY geodesic integration code (see
<https://github.com/pierrechristian/FANTASY> + Pierre Christian and
Chi-kwan Chan 2021 *ApJ* **909** 67).

# Installation

## pip

``` bash
pip install event-horyzen
```

**or**

``` bash
pip install event-horzyen[pyqt]
```

(If you use `zsh` as your shell you will need to quote the package name
for optional dependencies, i.e., "event-horyzen\[pyqt\]")

Depending on whether or not you'd like to use the `pyqtgraph` and
`opengl` plotting modules (They are not small dependencies. The option
to plot with matplotlib is included in the base package).

## Manually

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/UCF-SPS-Research-21/event-horyzen
```

If you use Poetry for package and venv management, you can use

``` bash
poetry install
```

**or**

``` bash
poetry install -E pyqt
```

If you don't, you can `pip install -r requirements.txt` or
`conda install --file requirements.txt`. There are multiple versions of
requirements.txt provided, it should be evident what each is for.

# Usage

The code is configured with a YAML configuration file. Please see the
example at [file:event_horyzen/config.yml](event_horyzen/config.yml)

## Example

**I use Unix paths in the examples. Windows paths will work too â€” just
make sure you escape backslashes or make use of `pathlib`'s
functionality.**

If you'd like to use the default configuration, you can just leave the
argument to `event_horyzen.run()` empty. To copy the default config and
edit it, do the following.

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import event_horyzen

dest = Path("./foo/")
event_horyzen.copy_default_config(dest)
```

If you don't specify a destination, it will copy the file to your
current working directory. Now, assuming you've edited the config to
your liking and its named `config.yml`:

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import event_horyzen

conf_path = Path('./config.yml')
event_horyzen.run(conf_path)
```

**or for multiple geodesics simulated in parallel**

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import event_horyzen

conf_path1 = Path('./config1.yml')
conf_path2 = Path('./config2.yml')
conf_path3 = Path('./config3.yml')

confs = [conf_path1, conf_path2, conf_path3]

event_horyzen.run(confs)
```

A unique directory under the output directory specified in the
configuration file will be created in the format
`<output-dir>/<date+time>_<name-of-config-file>`. So, it makes sense to
give your configuration files meaningful names. The geodesic in both
spherical and cartesian coordinates will be saved to this directory as
`results.h5`. The configuration file used to generate the simulation
will be copied to this directory as well to ensure reproducibility. A
basic plot of the geodesic is also created and saved in the directory as
both a .PNG and a `pickle` file so that the figure can be reloaded and
interacted with. [Example Kerr-Newman Plot](./example-kerr-newman.png)

If you want to load the pickled Matplotlib plot, you can do the
following.

``` python
import pickle as pl
from pathlib import Path

plot_path = Path("<path-to-plot>/basic-plot.pickle")

with open(plot_path, "rb") as plot:
    fig = pl.load(plot)

# Now do whatever you want with the figure!

fig.show()
```

For the 3D plotting,

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import animated_plot as ap

results = Path("./results.h5")
viz = ap.Visualizer(results)
viz.animation()
```

**or for multiple geodesics on the same plot**

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import animated_plot as ap

results1 = Path("./results1.h5")
results2 = Path("./results2.h5")
results3 = Path("./results3.h5")

results = [results1, results2, results3]

viz = ap.Visualizer(results)
viz.animation()
```

By default, it puts a photon sphere for a M=1 (geometrized units)
schwarzschild black hole on the plot for reference. This can be turned
off or modified in the call to `Visualizer()`.

**Both the simulation and the plotting can be ran directly from the
command line**

First, the simulation tools.

``` bash
event-horyzen -h
```

``` bash
usage: event-horyzen [-h] [datapath ...]

positional arguments:
  datapath    The path(s) to the configuration file(s). Defaults to the
              included `config.yml` if not provided.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Now, the plotting tools.

``` bash
event-horyzen-plot -h
```

``` bash
usage: event-horyzen-plot [-h] datapath [datapath ...]

positional arguments:
  datapath    The path(s) to the data file(s).

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
