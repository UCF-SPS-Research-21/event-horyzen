#+TITLE: Event hoRyzen
*Event hoRyzen* is a Python library designed to simulate and visualize geodesic motion around Schwarzschild, Reisner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman black holes.
It uses a slightly modified version of Pierre Christian and Chi-kwan Chan's FANTASY geodesic integration code (see https://github.com/pierrechristian/FANTASY + Pierre Christian and Chi-kwan Chan 2021 /ApJ/ *909* 67).

* Installation
** pip
#+begin_src bash :eval never
pip install event_horyzen
#+end_src

*or*
#+begin_src bash  :eval never
pip install event_horzyen[pyqt]
#+end_src

Depending on whether or not you'd like to use the =pyqtgraph= and =opengl= plotting modules (They are not small dependencies. The option to plot with matplotlib is included in the base package).
** Manually
#+begin_src bash :eval never
git clone https://github.com/UCF-SPS-Research-21/research-proj21
#+end_src

If you use Poetry for package and venv management, you can use
#+begin_src bash :eval never
pip install event_horyzen
#+end_src

*or*
#+begin_src bash  :eval never
pip install event_horzyen[pyqt]
#+end_src

If you don't, you can =pip install -r requirements.txt= or =conda install --file requirements.txt=.
There are multiple versions of requirements.txt provided, it should be evident what each is for.

* Usage
The code is configured with a YAML configuration file.
Please see the example at [[file:event_horyzen/config.yml]]

** Example
#+begin_src python :eval never
from pathlib import Path
from event_horyzen import event_horyzen

conf_path = Path('./config.yml')
event_horyzen.run(conf_path)
#+end_src

The geodesic in both spherical and cartesian coordinates will be saved to the output directory specified in the configuration file as =results.h5=.
A basic plot of the geodesic is also produced.
